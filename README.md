# Getting Started

## Documentation

The code is documented with jsdoc comments.

The documentation for the latest stable code (`master` branch) is available online at [https://beforan.github.io/unit-value/](https://beforan.github.io/unit-value/).

The documentation relevant to the commit you are looking at should always be present inside `/docs`, but you can always build the current docs for the code you're looking at by running `npm run docs`.

### A note on pre-commit hooks

Documentation is kept accurate and up-to-date through the use of a precommit hook. When you commit to git, the docs are automagically built and staged. Bear this in mind if commits appear to be taking longer than usual. If you encounter issues committing, ensure that all npm dev dependencies have been installed with `npm install`, and that you have `git` available in your `PATH`.
